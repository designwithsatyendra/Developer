            Satyendra Singh,I want to tell everyone that my father is a farmer and I have completed my studies in
            2019.After that my father took a loan and sent me to Hyderabad to study.There I did full stack developer
            coaching from Naresh IT Technology.After completion of coaching, I came to Bangalore for job.I got a job
            here, after that I lost my job due to Corona virus.Right now I have nothing. And my father is asking me
            money for my sister's marriage. I need money for my sister's marriage.So I decided to share my knowledge on
            YouTube. For 2 Month's I have been sharing knowledge on coding and uploading many videos on YouTube. So I
            believed in "Just keep doing the good things in life by helping others and don't expect anything in return
            because God is watching and Karma will give us everything for sure‚Äù.
